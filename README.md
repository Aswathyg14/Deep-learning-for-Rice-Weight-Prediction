# Deep-learning-for-Rice-Weight-Prediction
In this project we've used deep learning methods for predicting rice weights using images.
The methodology involves curating a diverse dataset of rice grain images, capturing variations in size, shape, and colour. The dataset is crucial for training the CNN, enabling it to learn intricate patterns and features indicative of rice weight. The convolutional layers of the network automatically extract spatial hierarchies, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the visual cues associated with variations in rice mass.
